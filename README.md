# Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass Projects
This repository contains all my Data Science and Machine Learning Projects from Jose Portilla's Python  for Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Masterclass.

The Projects includes;

---
## Feature Engineering
In this project, I worked on the following:
- Dealing with Outliers
- Dealing with Missing Data
- Dealing with Categorical Data

The Dataset used for this project is the <a href='http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf'>Amens Housing dataset</a>.

---
## Linear Regression
This project involved working on the <a href='http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf'>Amens Housing dataset</a>, carrying out feature engineering on the dataset and building a Linear Regression Model for predicting the SalsePrice from the features in the dataset.

## Logistic Regression
The goal of this project is to creat a Classification Model that can predict whether or not a person has presence of heart disease based on physical features of that person (age, sex, cholesterol, etc...).

The data set used for this project is the <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease'>Heart Disease Dataset</a>
