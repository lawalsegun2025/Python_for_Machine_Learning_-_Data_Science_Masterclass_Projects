# Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass Projects
This repository contains all my Data Science and Machine Learning Projects from Jose Portilla's Python  for Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Masterclass.

The Projects includes the following;

---
## Feature Engineering Project
In this project, I worked on the following:
- Dealing with Outliers
- Dealing with Missing Data
- Dealing with Categorical Data

The Dataset used for this project is the <a href='http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf'>Amens Housing dataset</a>.

---
## Linear Regression Project
This project involved working on the <a href='http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf'>Amens Housing dataset</a>, carrying out feature engineering on the dataset and building a Linear Regression Model for predicting the SalsePrice from the features in the dataset.

## Logistic Regression Project
The goal of this project is to creat a Classification Model that can predict whether or not a person has presence of heart disease based on physical features of that person (age, sex, cholesterol, etc...).

The data set used for this project is the <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease'>Heart Disease Dataset</a>

Creators:

Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.

## K-Nearest Neighbors Project 


### The Sonar Data 

### Detecting a Rock or a Mine

Sonar (sound navigation ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.

The data set contains the response metrics for 60 separate sonar frequencies sent out against a known mine field (and known rocks). These frequencies are then labeled with the known object they were beaming the sound at (either a rock or a mine).

THe goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of detecting the difference between a rock or a mine based on the response of the 60 separate sonar frequencies.

## Support Vector Machines Project 

### [Fraud in Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_fraud)

Wine fraud relates to the commercial aspects of wine. The most prevalent type of fraud is one where wines are adulterated, usually with the addition of cheaper products (e.g. juices) and sometimes with harmful chemicals and sweeteners (compensating for color or flavor).

Counterfeiting and the relabelling of inferior and cheaper wines to more expensive brands is another common type of wine fraud.

### Project Goals

A distribution company that was recently a victim of fraud has completed an audit of various samples of wine through the use of chemical analysis on samples. The distribution company specializes in exporting extremely high quality, expensive wines, but was defrauded by a supplier who was attempting to pass off cheap, low quality wine as higher grade wine. The distribution company has hired you to attempt to create a machine learning model that can help detect low quality (a.k.a "fraud") wine samples. They want to know if it is even possible to detect such a difference.

## Naive Bayes Project

### Goal

Given a set of text movie reviews that has been labelled negative or positive;
For more information on the dataset click: <a href='http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/'>here.</a>

Build a Naive Bayes Model that classifies each review as either positive or negative.
