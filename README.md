# Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass Projects
This repository contains all my Data Science and Machine Learning Projects from Jose Portilla's Python  for Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Masterclass.

The Projects includes;

---
## Feature Engineering Project
In this project, I worked on the following:
- Dealing with Outliers
- Dealing with Missing Data
- Dealing with Categorical Data

The Dataset used for this project is the <a href='http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf'>Amens Housing dataset</a>.

---
## Linear Regression
This project involved working on the <a href='http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf'>Amens Housing dataset</a>, carrying out feature engineering on the dataset and building a Linear Regression Model for predicting the SalsePrice from the features in the dataset.

## Logistic Regression
The goal of this project is to creat a Classification Model that can predict whether or not a person has presence of heart disease based on physical features of that person (age, sex, cholesterol, etc...).

The data set used for this project is the <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease'>Heart Disease Dataset</a>

Creators:

Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.

## K-Nearest Neighbors Project 


### The Sonar Data 

### Detecting a Rock or a Mine

Sonar (sound navigation ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.

The data set contains the response metrics for 60 separate sonar frequencies sent out against a known mine field (and known rocks). These frequencies are then labeled with the known object they were beaming the sound at (either a rock or a mine).

THe goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of detecting the difference between a rock or a mine based on the response of the 60 separate sonar frequencies.
